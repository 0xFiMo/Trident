### Why "Trident"?

A trident has three prongs — none works alone. Remove one and it's just a stick. Trident applies the same idea to AI agents: `Generator`, `Discriminator`, and `Arbiter` — three roles that hold each other accountable. No single agent can declare its own work "done."

---

### The Problem

You ask your AI agent to build something. It does. You ask it to review its own work. It says "looks good." You ship it. Then production breaks.

**This keeps happening because:**

| What you expect | What actually happens |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Handle all edge cases" | Agent handles the happy path, skips the rest |
| "Write production-quality code" | No input validation, no error boundaries |
| "Review your work" | Agent reviews its own code and finds nothing wrong |
| "Fix the bug" | Agent fixes one bug, introduces two more |

The root cause: **an AI agent reviewing its own work is like a student grading their own exam.** The incentive is to pass, not to find problems.

### The Fix

**Let a second AI agent grade the exam.** And a third one make sure neither is cheating.

Trident turns one agent's monologue into a three-way adversarial review. The `Generator` builds. The `Discriminator` attacks. The `Arbiter` keeps them honest. Your code ships only when all three agree it's ready.

Works with any model. Even non-tier-1 models produce senior-level output with Trident — because quality comes from the process, not just the model.

## Commands

`/tri` — sounds like "try." Every great creation starts with a try.

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/tri new "description"` | **Try** a new design. `Generator` designs, `Discriminator` scores, `Arbiter` verifies. Iterates until all 7 dimensions >= 9. |
| `/tri apply` | **Try** to build it. Three Strikes — 3 rounds of `Generator` + `Discriminator` + `Arbiter` verification. |
| `/tri archive` | Done **try**ing. Archive it and extract what you learned. |
| `/tri status` | Check what you're **try**ing and what's done. |
| `/tri models` | Configure which models power each role. |
| `/tri auto "description"` | Full cycle — design + implement in one go. |

The lifecycle is strictly sequential. The agent cannot skip ahead:

## Does It Actually Work?

Same model (`Kimi K2.5`). Same prompt. Same task. Only difference: one used Trident, one didn't.

**Without Trident** — agent delivers code with 6 hidden issues. Tests pass. Looks fine. Ships broken.

**With Trident** — `Discriminator` catches all 6 in adversarial review. Fixed before a single line ships.

**Tests catch logic bugs. Trident catches everything tests can't:**

| | Tests alone | + Trident |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Input validation gaps | ❌ | ✅ |
| Encapsulation leaks | ❌ | ✅ |
| API design flaws | ❌ | ✅ |
| Concurrency semantics | ❌ | ✅ |

## How It Works

### The Triforce — Three Roles

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/asset/triforce.png" alt="Triforce — Generator, Discriminator, Arbiter" width="600">
</p>

| Role | Analogy | Memory | What It Actually Does |
|------|---------|--------|----------------------|
| `Generator` | GAN Generator | Persistent | Explores codebase. Produces designs with root cause analysis, state transition tables, change surface estimates. Implements code. Self-audits against its own spec. |
| `Discriminator` | GAN Discriminator | Session continuity | Scores every design across 7 dimensions. Cites specific methods, line numbers, data flow. Classifies issues as MUST FIX or NICE TO HAVE. Accumulates knowledge — never re-checks what it already verified. |
| `Arbiter` | Independent evaluator | None (always fresh) | Zero context, zero bias. Checks if `Generator` and `Discriminator` are colluding. Catches blind spots neither addressed. Can override READY if convergence looks artificial. |

**Why three, not two?** A `Generator` + `Discriminator` pair converges too easily. The `Discriminator` gets lenient after watching the `Generator` improve. The `Arbiter` prevents this — fresh every time, no sympathy.

### Seven Dimensions

Every design is scored across 7 dimensions. **All must reach >= 9/10 score:**

| Dimension | What It Measures |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Correctness | Logic correct, no crash on any input |
| Algorithmic Soundness | All scenarios, boundaries, interactions |
| Safety | Defensive input validation, fail-safe, backward compat |
| Measurability | Verification coverage with available resources |
| Minimality | Minimal change surface |
| Testability | Test coverage, edge cases |
| Conventions | Matches existing codebase patterns |

Missing input validation? **MUST FIX**, never NICE TO HAVE. If any input can crash your code, Safety cannot be >= 9/10.

### Design Phase (`/tri new`)

`Generator` and `Discriminator` iterate until all 7 dimensions pass. No round limit.


### Implementation Phase (`/tri apply`)

Three Strikes — three rounds, then escalate to human:

| Round | Roles | On `Discriminator` Pass | On `Discriminator` Fail |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | `Generator` implements + `Discriminator` reviews | `Arbiter` verifies → done or keep fixing | Round 2 |
| 2 | `Generator` fixes + `Discriminator` re-reviews (same session) | `Arbiter` verifies → done or keep fixing | Round 3 |
| 3 | `Generator` + `Arbiter` collaborate | Done | Human-in-the-loop escalation |

**Key rule:** `Discriminator` FAIL consumes a round. `Arbiter` FAIL does NOT — `Generator` fixes and re-submits within the same round.

Round 3 exhausted? `Generator`, `Discriminator`, and `Arbiter` each submit their perspective. The human decides.

### Archive Phase (`/tri archive`)

Done? Archive it. Trident moves the working files to `.trident/archive/` and asks one question:

> *"This review uncovered insights about [domain]. Want me to create a skill?"*

If yes — the agent distills root causes, design decisions, and pitfalls into a reusable skill. Your agent gets smarter with every review.

### Model Configuration (`/tri models`)

Not all roles need the same brain. The `Generator` writes code — a fast, affordable model works fine. The `Discriminator` and `Arbiter` only review — a stronger model catches more issues. Use `/tri models` to configure each role independently:

```
/tri models

  Trident Model Configuration:

  | Role          | Job                             | Model                            |
  |---------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
  | Generator     | designs and implements code     | minimax-coding-plan/MiniMax-M2.7 |
  | Discriminator | scores and reviews (the critic) | anthropic/claude-opus-4-6        |
  | Arbiter       | independent final check         | anthropic/claude-opus-4-6        |
```

This isn't just about cost — it's about **blind spot diversity**. If all three roles use the same model, they share the same weaknesses. A bug that one model can't see, all three will miss. Different models have different blind spots — what MiniMax overlooks, Claude might catch, and vice versa.

### One Command, Full Cycle (`/tri auto`)

Don't want to run `/tri new` and `/tri apply` separately? Use `/tri auto` — it runs the full design-to-implementation cycle in one go, then stops for you to review before archiving.

```
/tri auto "fix memory leak on disconnect"

→ Design phase (Generator ↔ Discriminator ↔ Arbiter) → READY
→ Implementation phase (Three Strikes) → Done
→ Waits for you to /tri archive
```

## Design Philosophy

### Three Pillars

| Pillar | Origin | What It Prevents |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **GAN** | Generative Adversarial Networks | Complacency — `Generator` can't ship until `Discriminator` is satisfied, `Discriminator` can't rubber-stamp because `Arbiter` is watching |
| **Three Strikes** | Baseball + Chinese proverb | Infinite loops — three rounds max, then escalate to human |
| **Triforce** | Three-role balance | Collusion — `Generator` and `Discriminator` can't agree to lower standards because `Arbiter` arrives fresh with no history |

### Space for Memory

AI agents forget. Context windows fill up. Sessions expire. Trident solves this by **trading disk space for memory** — each role writes its knowledge to markdown files that persist across sessions, rounds, and even platform restarts.

These files serve three purposes at once:
1. **Agent memory** — `Generator`, `Discriminator`, and `Arbiter` recover context from their own files instead of relying on session state
2. **Role isolation** — each role can only read the other's file, never write to it. No contamination.
3. **Human auditability** — open any `.md` file to see exactly what each role thought, scored, and decided. No black box.

```
.trident/{task-slug}/
├── generator.md        ← Generator's memory: design + version history + feedback
├── discriminator.md    ← Discriminator's memory: verified facts, patterns, blind spots
├── tasks.md            ← Implementation checklist (created by /tri apply)
├── apply-log.md        ← Round log with 7-dimension scores
└── .done               ← Signal file for background agent completion
```

| File | Who Writes | Who Reads | Survives Session Loss? |
|------|-----------|-----------|:----------------------:|
| `generator.md` | `Generator` | All roles | Yes — full design history |
| `discriminator.md` | `Discriminator` | All roles | Yes — `Discriminator` rebuilds context from this |
| `tasks.md` | `Generator` | `Generator` | Yes — resume from last checkbox |
| `apply-log.md` | `Generator` | All roles | Yes — round scores preserved |
| `.done` | `Discriminator` or `Arbiter` | heartbeat.sh | Transient — deleted before each invocation |
